# ProxyCharm

ProxyCharm is an application for collecting and testing free proxies from various online sources, using a professional proxy provider to perform the scraping requests.

## Usage Disclaimer

- **Limited Liability**: ProxyCharm is designed to collect and test proxies that can be used for web scraping purposes. We do not assume any responsibility for the use of the proxies or the data obtained through the application. Users are responsible for complying with local laws, privacy regulations, and the terms of service of the websites they scrape.
  
- **Exclusive Use for Scraping**: Users must use ProxyCharm solely for collecting data via proxies and not for transmitting data to external websites without proper authorization. Any use of ProxyCharm for purposes other than scraping is prohibited.

- **Security Limitations**: We are not responsible for any damages caused by the use of free proxies collected through ProxyCharm. We do not guarantee that proxies will always be available, secure, or fast. Users must be aware of the risks associated with using free proxies and must always test and validate proxies before using them for large-scale scraping.

- **Data Protection**: We are not liable for any privacy or security breaches related to the use of these proxies. Users must refrain from sending sensitive information through proxies obtained with ProxyCharm, such as personal data or financial information.

- **Compliance with Laws**: Users must use ProxyCharm in compliance with all applicable local laws, including those relating to privacy, data protection, and intellectual property rights.

## How It Works

1. **Proxy Collection**: ProxyCharm collects proxies from verified online sources, testing each proxy to determine its speed, stability, and availability.
2. **Proxy Testing**: Once collected, the proxies are tested to check if they work, their latency, and support for the required protocols.
3. **Proxy Management**: Working proxies are saved in a local database and can be used for scraping or other operations that require anonymity.
